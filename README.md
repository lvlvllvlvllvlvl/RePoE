# RePoE

## Deprecated, please use https://github.com/repoe-fork/repoe-fork instead.

This version of the repo commits images to the repo using git-lfs, however github's lfs service has several technical limitations that l have decided make it not worth using.

The new version serves images from gh-pages only; to remove lfs l had to create a whole new repo due to a technical limitation of github's lfs service.
